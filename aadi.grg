ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aadi Garg
I'm a third-year Computer Science student specializing in scalable web development with the MERN stack. I enjoy designing efficient RESTful APIs with Node.js and building responsive user interfaces with React.

Beyond this, I am fascinated by decentralized technology and am actively learning blockchain development with Solidity and exploring the Ethereum ecosystem. My goal is to merge these interests to build secure, high-performance applications that are both user-friendly and transparent.

ðŸ”­ I'm proud of my recent participation in the Smart India Hackathon, where my team built a Blockchain-based Blue Carbon Registry.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deepening my understanding of System Design principles for building large-scale applications.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in the Web3 or backend development space.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, JavaScript, the MERN stack, and applying algorithms to real-world problems (like my Splitwise project!).
